Creating Space Types for SecondarySchool.
Combining Classroom and Corridor into a group representing a double loaded corridor
You selected a perimeter multiplier greater than 1.0 for a supported bar division method. This will result in two detached rectangular buildings if secondary bar meets minimum size requirements.
Minimum rectangle is 417 ft x 199 ft with an area of 82,773 ft^2. Perimeter is 1,231 ft.
Target dual bar perimeter is 1,930 ft.
Stretched  742 ft x 112 ft rectangle has an area of 82,773 ft^2. When split in two the perimeter will be 1,930 ft
For stretched split bar, to match target ns/ew aspect ratio 542 ft of bar should be horizontal, with 200 ft turned 90 degrees. Combined area is 82,773 ft^2. Combined perimeter is 1,930 ft
Making bar with length of 542 ft and width of 112 ft
Intersecting and matching surfaces in model, this will create additional geometry.
Created bar envelope with floor area of 120,978 ft^2. Total building area is 120,978 ft^2.
Ground exposed floor or Roof area is larger than footprint, likely inter-floor surface matching and intersection error, altering impacted surfaces boundary condition to be adiabatic.
Making bar with length of 112 ft and width of 200 ft
Intersecting and matching surfaces in model, this will create additional geometry.
Created bar envelope with floor area of 43,394 ft^2. Total building area is 164,372 ft^2.
Ground exposed floor or Roof area is larger than footprint, likely inter-floor surface matching and intersection error, altering impacted surfaces boundary condition to be adiabatic.
Making bar with length of 309 ft and width of 147 ft
Intersecting and matching surfaces in model, this will create additional geometry.
Created bar envelope with floor area of 45,341 ft^2. Total building area is 209,713 ft^2.
